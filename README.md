# iDAAS-Connect-ThirdParty
iDAAS has several key components that provide many capabilities. iDAAS Connect is intended ONLY
to enable iDAAS connectivity. iDAAS-Connect-ThirdParty specifically ONLY deals with enabling 
iDAAS to all sorts of third party connectivity. For example: RDBMS, Kafka, Mainframe, Files, SFTP, etc.
plus dozens of others are supported.

This solution contains three supporting directories. The intent of these artifacts to enable
resources to work locally: <br/>
+ platform-scripts: support running kafka, creating/listing and deleting topics needed for this solution
and also building and packaging the solution as well. All the scripts are named to describe their capabilities <br/>
+ platform-testdata: sample transactions to leverage for using the platform. 

# Scenario(s): Kafka Integration 
This repository follows a very common general implementation. The only connector currently in this code
base is a Kafka topic. The key sceanrio this can demonstrate is data being processed from a data science 
kafka topic.

## Integration Data Flow Steps



1. The Kafka client connects to a particular broker and topic and checks if there is any data to process. 
2. If there is data it will audit the transaction processing 
3. The transaction will be routed for processing within iDAAS 
    
## Builds
This section will cover both local and automated builds.

### Local Builds
Within the code base you can find the local build commands in the /platform-scripts directory
1.  Run the build-solution.sh script
It will run the maven commands to build and then package up the solution. The package will use the usual settings
in the pom.xml file. It pulls the version and concatenates the version to the output jar it builds.
Additionally, there is a copy statement to remove any specific version, so it outputs idaas-connect-hl7.jar

### Automated Builds
Automated Builds are going to be done in Azure Pipelines
